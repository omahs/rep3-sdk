# POCP Service SDK

The Proof of Contribution Protocol (or PoCP) is the beta version of rep3's credentialing protocol. The rep3 DAO tool (live at https://app.rep3.gg/) is one possible implementation of the protocol to facilitate better member and contribution management for DAOs.

Using the protocol, DAOs can give various types of badges to their members. These badges are organised in a parent-child relationship -- first, all members receive a membership badge (which is the parent badge), and then members can receive contribution badges (representing their work) or any other type of badge as designed by the community (for example, one-off badges to acknowledge exemplary work). The contribution badges and the custom badges are children to the membership badge.

This architecture lets communities track and visualise their member activity and, on the other hand, lets community members build their portfolio of work through on-chain credentials. These naturally have a higher signalling value than more traditional types of portfolios like resumÃ©s.

Badges given through the rep3 platform are also fully interoperable with several web3 tools, especially those that are used for gating resources behind a token. These badges, at a contract level, are custom implmentations of ERC-721 tokens. This is a deliberate decision to balance the trade-off between maintaining the integrity of these badges (w.r.t. the work they represent) and permitting key rotation by users.

The rest of this document details the technical specifications and integration process of our protocol. Please note that this document might be confusing to understand or even have some outdated parts. We are in the process of updating these as we begin to focus on protocol-level integrations in addition to focussing on tool adoption.

As always, do not hesitate at all to reach out to any team member in case you have a question. We usually reply within 12h and will be more than happy to address any questions you may have. 

Have a great day ahead!

## Installation

Install the package with yarn or npm:

```bash
npm install pocp-service-sdk
yarn add pocp-service-sdk
```

## Getting Started

The three main functions of this protocol are registering community on the protocol, approving and claiming membership badges and issuing contribution/appreciation/pariticipation badges on memberships. These functions (as found in pocp-service-sdk/src/pocp/index.ts/) are described below. Let's go through them one-by-one. 
>Note: These three interactions (and others mentioned later) can be done directly through interacting with contracts or through a relayer.

### 1. Instantiating Pocp
>Note: `callback_function_tx_reciept` in many functions sends transaction reciept as params, and `callback_function_confirming_events` send contract emmitted events as params

```javascript
import Pocp from "pocp-service-sdk"

# add relyer_token for a gasless transaction


// For Polygon mainnet
chainId = 137
contractAddressConfig ={
      pocpManger: "0xDA6F4387C344f1312439E05E9f9580882abA6958",
      pocpBeacon: "0x083842b3F6739948D26C152C137929E0D3a906b9",
      pocpRouter: "0xB9Acf5287881160e8CE66b53b507F6350d7a7b1B",
}

// For Polygon Mumbai
chainId = 80001
contractAddressConfig = {
      pocpManger: "0xf00eAbb380752fed6414f3C12e3D8F976C7D024d",
      pocpBeacon: "0xDcc7133abBA15B8f4Bf155A372C17744E0941f28",
      pocpRouter: "0x1C6D20042bfc8474051Aba9FB4Ff85880089A669",
}

import { Biconomy } from "@biconomy/mexa"
config = {
      biconomyInstance:Biconomy,
      apiKey: <api-key-biconomy>,
      relayURL: <rpc-url>,
}

const pocp = new Pocp(
      signer, null, walletProvider, chainId,
      contractAddressConfig
      config
)
await pocp.createInstance()

```



### 1. Registering community
The first step to using this protocol is registering community on the protocol. This is done by the community admin(s) using the `daoDeploy` function. This takes the name of the DAO and an array of owners' addresses as parameters. In case you want to listen to the event emitted, you can pass it as an  callbackFunction which takes the event emitted as its parameter.

>Note: callback functions can be listened for transaction hash which can be used to get the contract address of a dao.

```javascript

await pocp.daoDeploy(
      "<YourDAOName>", 
      "<YourDAOERC721Symbol>",
      ["<approverAddress_1>", "<approverAddress_2>", ..]
      "0x083842b3F6739948D26C152C137929E0D3a906b9 (for mainnet) / 0xDcc7133abBA15B8f4Bf155A372C17744E0941f28 (for mumbai)",
      "0xB9Acf5287881160e8CE66b53b507F6350d7a7b1B (for mainnet) / 0x1C6D20042bfc8474051Aba9FB4Ff85880089A669 (for mumbai)",,
      callback_function_tx_reciept, //triggered once hash is received
      callback_function_confirming_events, //triggered once tx is confirmed
)

```


### 2. Approving membership
Before contributors can mint the badge to their addresses, the community admins must "ready" the badge for claiming. This is done via the `createMembershipVoucher` function. It takes the proxy contract address of a dao, array of levels in integer,array of category in integer, refer to note below for array of end,array of contributor's address, string of arweave or ipfs metadata hash seperating it by comma. For supporting back versioning of rep3 protocol, we have sign type version for different updates. The current rep3 Protocol supports "signTypedDatav2.0" and should be passed as a params.
>Note for end array : In example below first 3 address from contributors address have to be approved for level1 and category2 so the first element       in the end array is 2 and as the remaining combination i.e level2 and category4 is for remaining 2 address as it's ending address is at the end         of contributors array the second element in end array is 4. If all arrays refers to same level and category, send it as a empty array

```javascript
const signedVoucher:<signedVoucher> = await pocp.createMembershipVoucher(
            contractAddress,
            [1,2],      // [<Levels of membership represented in 0,1...etc.>]
            [2,4],      // [<Levels of categories represented in 0,1...etc.>]
            [2,4],      // refer to note section above
            ["0x0EB...4b53","0x0FG...3s67","0x0RT...3dfr3","0x0WE...3ar4T","0x0re4...3d534"],   // [<claimer address>]
            "AdaDsjj...DGdI,Sdgguedsj...sfgadfD,",    //<string of metadata_hash seperated by comma>
            "signTypedDatav2.0"     //<Type of signature version>
        )
 // returns object of signed voucher
      {
            "data":[257],
            "end":[],
            "to":["0x2669B5e41a56989EE58a2195f2bC54337c48c670"],
            "tokenUris":"GrMjwgeaivFF0kkculkkzGeoxJUD0ChSiBpXc8DPPME,",
      "signature":"0xc7453943fc82666aa5352d7a6fad6ca017eb4ce97d750a7f84604c501d5778ea06e61ffab6f7b56bfba765809376dbc0407639b3c923168f7c4cd7c5543cf28a1c"
      }
```

### 3. Claiming membership NFT
The voucher created by the admin or approver of dao by signing the membership approval can be used to claim membership NFT by the contributor or the member of dao by using `claimMembershipNft`. The function takes proxy contract address of a dao, signed voucher, index of address in signed voucher, version of sign used while approving membership. In case you want to listen to the event emitted, you can pass it as an callbackFunction which takes the event emitted as its parameter. Or you can get the transaction reciept by getting the params of transaction hash callback function.

```javascript

await pocp.claimMembershipNft(
        contractAddress,
        <Signed-Voucher>,
        0,  //<index of address in signed voucher>
        "signTypedDatav2.0",  //<Type of signature version>
        callback_function_tx_reciept, //triggered once hash is received
       callback_function_confirming_events, //triggered once tx is confirmed
  )
```


### 4. Upgrading membership NFT
Approver of a dao can upgrade or downgrade membership NFTs of a contributor or a member of dao via `upgradeMembershipNft` by passing dao's contract address, tokenId of the membership NFT, level to which it should be upgraded or downgraded, category to which it should be upgraded or downgraded, ipfs or arweave hash for the NFT. In case you want to listen to the event emitted, you can pass it as an  callbackFunction which takes the event emitted as its parameter. Or you can get the transaction reciept by getting the params of transaction hash callback function.

```javascript

await pocp.upgradeMembershipNft(
        contractAddress,
        1,  //<membershipNft token id>
        2,  //<Upgrading level represented in number>
        3,  //<Upgrading category represented in number>
      "AdaDsjj...DGdI", //<metadata_hash of upgrading NFT>
      callback_function_tx_reciept, //triggered once hash is received
      callback_function_confirming_events, //triggered once tx is confirmed
    )
```

### 5. Claiming Association Badges
The voucher created by the admin or approver of dao by signing the contribution approval can be used to claim association NFT by the contributor or the member of dao by using `claimContributionBadges`. The function takes proxy contract address of a dao, signed voucher,membershipNFT token Id of contributor, index of address in signed voucher. In case you want to listen to the event emitted, you can pass it as an  callbackFunction which takes the event emitted as its parameter. Or you can get the transaction reciept by getting the params of transaction hash callback function.

`>Note : It is adviced to keep the length of array same as the array of address. Keep an element in arrayOfData to be 0 as default.`

```javascript

await pocp.claimContributionBadges(
            contractAddress,
            <Signed_Voucher>,
            1,    //<membershipNft token id>
            1,    //<index of address in signed voucher>
            callback_function_tx_reciept, //triggered once hash is received
            callback_function_confirming_events, //triggered once tx is confirmed
        )
```

## Some Other Functions 

There are also some other functions that can, in general, help teams get their usage history of the protocol. These functions (as found in 
pocp-service-sdk/src/pocpGetters/index.ts) are described below. Let's go through them one-by-one.
>Note: These three interactions (and others mentioned later) can be done directly through interacting with contracts or through a relayer.

>Note: As Rep3 Protocol makes uses of subgraphs for quering contract. Devs can write their custom logics on rep3 subgraph

```
      Rep3 Subgraph Urls
      mumbai https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/eth-jashan/rep3-mumbai
      matic https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/eth-jashan/rep3-matic
```

### 1. Initialize pocp getter instance
The PocpGetters class is initiated by the subgraph url.

```javascript
 import { PocpGetters } from "pocp-service-sdk"
      
 const pocpGetter = new PocpGetters(<Mumbai-Subgraph-url/Matic-Subgraph-url>)

```
### 2. Get dao contract address from transaction hash
The `getdaoInfoForHash` getter function takes the transaction hash of `daoDeploy`, and returns the details of dao in contract.

```javascript
 const daoInfo:<DaoDetails> = await pocpGetter.getdaoInfoForHash(
       `0xfsfs...sfaiee` // transaction hash
 )
 
      // returns value DaoDetail
      {
        "id": "0x00c51890d6c9da0a7e85ed6682b8b59249f60f5f", // proxy contract address
        "name": "",
        "symbol": "",
        "txHash": "0x104d4adb421cb0b3e81b05549488e1fd3f75132bafe451971505607e419fd6f3"
      },
 
```

### 3. Get membershipNft from transaction hash
The `getMembershipNftsForHash` getter function takes the transaction hash of `claimMembershipNft` function , and returns the details of membership NFTs.

```javascript
      
 const membershipNft<MembershipNftDetaails> = await pocpGetter.getMembershipNftsForHash(
       `0xfje...vdvd` // transaction hash
 )
      // returns value MembershipNftDetail
      {
        "id": "0x00c51890d6c9da0a7e85ed6682b8b59249f60f5f", // proxy contract address
        "name": "",
        "symbol": "",
        "txHash": "0x104d4adb421cb0b3e81b05549488e1fd3f75132bafe451971505607e419fd6f3"
      },

 
```

### 4. Get membershipNft for a claimer address and contract address
The `membershipNftWithClaimerOfDao` getter function takes the `claimer address` and `contract address` of `daoDeploy`, and returns the array of details of membership NFTs.

```javascript
      
 const membershipNfts = await pocpGetter.membershipNftWithClaimerOfDao(<Claimer-Address>,<Contract-Address>)
 
      // returns value MembershipNftDetails
      [{
        "id": "0x00c51890d6c9da0a7e85ed6682b8b59249f60f5f", // proxy contract address
        "name": "",
        "symbol": "",

      }],
 
```

### 4. Custom Query for getters
The `getForCustomQuery` getter function takes the `custom the graph protcol query` and `object of variables`, and returns the array of details of membership NFTs.

```javascript

const associationBadgeQuery = `
query($claimer: String,$contractAddress:String ) {
  associationBadges(where:{claimer:$claimer,contractAddress:$contractAddress}){
    id
    metadatUri
    claimer
    type
    txHash
    membershipId
    contractAddress{
      id
    }
    tokenID
  }
}
`;

const associationBadgeVariable = {claimer:"0x565CB...e9C7",contractAddress:"0x5544...fdq31" }
      
 const customResult = await pocpGetter.subgraphGetterFunction(associationBadgeQuery,associationBadgeVariable)
 
```
